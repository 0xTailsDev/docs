title: '$TAILS Token'
description: 'A community-first approach to token distribution'
---

## Overview

The $TAILS token has not yet been officially launched. However, we're taking a new approach to token distribution will set a new standard for fairness and community alignment in DeFi.

## Community-First Distribution

Unlike traditional token launches that require upfront capital through presales or IDOs, $TAILS will be distributed retroactively to users who contribute to the platform's growth and success.

### Earning $TAILS

Users can earn their initial $TAILS distribution through various forms of platform engagement:

- **Liquidity Provision**: Providing and locking tFTM liquidity
- **Trading Activity**: Contributing to platform volume
- **Community Growth**: Referring new users to the platform

## No Presale, No Problems

We're taking a deliberate stance against the traditional presale model. Instead of requiring users to purchase tokens upfront, we're aligning token distribution with actual platform contribution and usage.

### Natural Growth Model

This distribution model creates a more organic and less predatory approach to token distribution:

1. **Zero Upfront Cost**: Users can earn their position in the ecosystem through participation
2. **Flexible Commitment**: Liquidity providers can withdraw their FTM after lock expiration
3. **Sustainable Yields**: Our market making vaults provide competitive yields to encourage long-term liquidity provision
