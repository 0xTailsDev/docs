## What is tFTM?

tFTM represents a groundbreaking approach to liquidity provision on perpetual protocols, enabling participants to act as market makers on Tails Exchange while simultaneously tapping into yields from multiple DeFi protocols. This innovative strategy, termed “multi-protocol rehypothecated yield optimization,” offers tFTM holders diverse streams of income.

## Pool Mechanics

### tFTM Vault Mechanics

Participants contribute assets to the tFTM vault, receiving tFTM tokens as representation of their share. Tails Exchange strategically allocates these assets across a range of protocols, including GMX, GNS, Ethena, and Aave, managing the positions on behalf of users. The allocated liquidity serves a dual purpose:

- It’s utilized for market making on the respective platforms, generating returns through trading fees and price movements.
- Tails Exchange leverages this liquidity to facilitate trading on its own platform, creating an additional layer of yield opportunities.

The platform aggregates yields from all sources - trading fees, interest from lending protocols, and rewards from liquidity provision - and channels them back to tFTM holders.

#### Advantages of Providing Liquidity to the tFTM Vault

Engaging with the tFTM vault offers several compelling benefits:

- Full retention of rewards from integrated protocols (Lending protocols, other Perps protocols, LSD protocols)
- A 50% share of Tails Exchange’s total protocol earnings
- Exposure to potential gains from market making activities across multiple platforms

This multi-faceted approach to yield generation positions tFTM as a cutting-edge tool for maximizing DeFi returns.

## Providing Liquidity

### Minting and Redeeming tFTM

#### Minting

To mint tFTM, users need to use any supported FTM based asset (such as FTM, aFTM, sFTM) and deposit it into the tFTM vault. The tFTM minted is based on the current tFTM price.

#### Redeeming

Redeeming tFTM is straightforward. Users enter the amount of tFTM and select a supported FTM based asset to redeem for the equivalent value. The tFTM is then burned, and the FTM based asset is sent to the user’s wallet.

#### Fees and Cooldown

Minting & Redeeming fees are dynamic based on market conditions, TVL, and other risk factors decided by the team. If we believe there is a high market risk, we may increase the fee to mint or redeem tFTM to protect the vault. Cooldown period: 1 day (24h) before minted tFTM can be redeemed.

### Additional Features

Users can mint tFTM cross-chain using various meta-aggregators like Axelar, Li.fi, and more.

## Why Choose tFTM?

tFTM provides liquidity for traders, allowing them to take positions with leverage. The relationship between tFTM holders and traders is as follows:

- If traders take a loss, tFTM holders will make a profit.
- If traders take a profit, tFTM holders will make a loss.

Rewards for providing liquidity and counterparty risk are based on the Sonic Chain where the tFTM was minted.

## Risks Associated with tFTM

Although tFTM value is market neutral and not directly affected by crypto market volatility, holding tFTM still carries risks:

- **Counterparty risk**: If traders make a profit, that profit is paid to the trader out of the tFTM pool.
- **Depegging risk**: In the unlikely scenario that any of the supported FTM derivative depegs, tFTM could be affected. For example, if USDT depegs, the tFTM price would be affected because USDT backs the vault, making its depeg percentage negatively affect the tFTM price.

## tFTM Liquidity Pool Mechanics

The open interest available for the platform is limited by the total FTM value (in units of FTM) available in tFTM. Traders cannot open a new position if the total platform open interest meets or exceeds the total TVL in tFTM.

A portion of all protocol-generated fees, including opening/closing positions, minting tFTM, borrow fees, and excess funding fees, as well as any losses from traders’ realized P&L and liquidations, go towards the tFTM vault, causing its price to increase over time. Any profits from traders’ realized P&L are paid out from the tFTM vault, causing its price to decrease.

The tFTM price is based on the number of USD and tFTM in the vault, at any time, where:

tFTM price = USD in vault / tFTM supply

### Fee Distribution

50% of all platform fees are automatically distributed to tFTM holders. There is no need to stake tFTM to receive these fees; simply holding tFTM automatically accrues additional value over time. This is similar to LSD tokens like stETH or sUSDe, where the value of the token increases over time because the fees are added to the vault directly, increasing the value of the token.
